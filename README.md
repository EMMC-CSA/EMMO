EMMO -- The European Materials Modelling Ontology
=================================================
This repository contains a reference implementation of an API and a set
some tools for working with EMMO.  The tools are written in Python3.

**WARNING**: This is work in progress...


Requirements
------------
* [Python3](https://www.python.org/)
* [Owlready2](https://bitbucket.org/jibalamy/owlready2)
* Java Virtual Machine (for reasoning using [HermiT](http://www.hermit-reasoner.com/))


Installation
------------
First thing is to install the requirements.  Then clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EMMC-CSA/EMMO
```


Quickstart
----------
Take a look at the tests for examples on how to use this package.  It is
possible to run them as scripts, like

```bash
cd EMMO/emmo/tests
python3 test_graph.py
```
